This folder contains all my favourite userscripts, including scripts written by me, scripts written by others, and scripts written by others which I have modified.

If you want to browse or install these scripts quickly, you can try browsing the "official" release page:

<!-- http://neuralyte.org/~joey/gm_scripts/joeys_userscripts_and_bookmarklets_overview.html -->
https://joeytwiddle.github.io/code/other/gm_scripts/joeys_userscripts_and_bookmarklets_overview.html

That page also lets you load the scripts as bookmarklets instead of userscripts.

<!--
The file `joeys_userscripts_and_bookmarklets_overview.html` can be also be useful for installing these scripts (it also lets you build bookmarklets as an alternative to installing a userscript) but you must serve that HTML page from an `http` or `https` URL (it doesnt work from `file://`).
-->

<!--
You can view <a href="https://joeytwiddle.github.io/code/other/gm_scripts/joeys_userscripts_and_bookmarklets_overview.html">Joey's Userscripts and Bookmarklets Overview Page</a> to quickly view source, install userscripts, and/or compile userscripts into bookmarklets.
-->



You can find a selection of them online at [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/users/joeytwiddle/scripts) or on [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/8615-joeytwiddle).

Or you can install a script by navigating to it in GitHub and hitting "Raw".

This is where the scripts are kept on GitHub: https://github.com/joeytwiddle/code/tree/master/other/gm_scripts  You can provide feedback or pull requests here.

## Should I write that userscript?

(Although I have a theory that automating common tasks is not only useful for *saving time*, but also allowing us to *stay focused* on our current task.)
