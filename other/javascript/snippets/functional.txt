<dysfigured> migrating to sanctuary and fluture from ramda, quality of life improvinh
<dysfigured> my typing apparently isnt
<sumyunseal1> when u grab my tail
<jaawerth> I've been meaning to try sanctuary
<jaawerth> lemme know how it goes
<sumyunseal1> my head is .........................here :D
<jaawerth> dysfigured: ^
<dysfigured> jaawerth: its great, its like ramda with runtime type checking (tjat you can disable)
<jaawerth> yeah that's what I saw, just wasn't sure how well that would fly in a practical application
<jaawerth> but I read through the docs and tinkered a bit, and it seems great. just hard to judge until I've tried to use it in a real project
<sumyunseal1> whens the last time u saw a practical nerd
<jaawerth> (or talk to somebody who has)
<dysfigured> theres not a huge overlap with ramda (looking at the intersection of the keys from each default export) it seems like they complement each other rather than replacing
<jaawerth> I dunno there seems to be a lot of crossover
<jaawerth> no lenses yet though
<jaawerth> then again, I kinda want those in a self-contained module
<jaawerth> sanctuary lenses would be great, though, since they could use sanctuary's Maybe
<dysfigured> 74 fns with the same name, ramda exports 246 fns, sanctuary 168
<jaawerth> sure, but how may of the missing ones do you use in ramda?
<jaawerth> ramda has a LOT and some of them are aliases - personally I don't use all of ramda's API
<jaawerth> a lot of the logical and combinator stuff, yeah, plus lenses and mappers/data manipulation
<dysfigured> a few, i dont think id be able to remove it, yeah i use lenses (with over) a lot
<systemfault> Everytime I try to do hardcore FP with JS, I regret it.
<systemfault> (Or even with TypeScript)
<dysfigured> but im appreciating what sanctuary offers while i try it
<sumyunseal1> exactly
<jaawerth> systemfault: yeah I'm usually happier when compromising - it's easier to turn your code unreadable if you go too hardcore on composition and fantasyland and such
