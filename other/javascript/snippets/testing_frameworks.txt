<iaincarsberg> so why qunit > jasmine?
<hughfdjackson> i saw some test cases in qunit, and they were nice and terse

@sneakertack nyc is good for coverage. istanbul is not really being updated. havenâ€™t tried blanket. mocha is ok. tape is really good. jest is really good too. i used to use ava for testing, was good for small stuff but as soon as you got to big projects it basically stalled my fairly new macbook for over a minute

(nyc is the thing to use after istanbul)

2020: <ljharb> darkjeepers: tape, mocha, or jest.
2021: <ljharb> qswz: jest for apps, tape for libs

If you are using mocha, this article: https://www.codementor.io/codementorteam/javascript-testing-framework-comparison-jasmine-vs-mocha-8s9k27za3
recommends using chai for assertions
sinon for test doubles
and karma if you want your mocha tests to hit a browser
