<grr12314> n> Object.create(Object(42)) instanceof Number

Call a function without using parens
<ETHproductions> top[Symbol.hasInstance]=alert;"Hello, World!"instanceof top

// This function is a syntax error
f = () => {foo: 3, bar: 4}
// But this one is not
f = () => {foobar: 5}
// Why?  Well neither is creating an object with properties inside.  In both cases, the {...} denote the body block of the function.  In there, foobar is a named label (which can be used with `break` or `continue` like a GOTO!)

// This looks like is should complain that no variable 'sausage' exists, but actually it runs ok
x = "test".join(() => sausage)
